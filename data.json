		"text": "As you relax back in your chair, your thoughts naturally drifts to your memories from 5 years ago. 5 years ago, you were still in university; you were still studying AI at CMU. You had jumped onto the AI major the very first year it was released, knowing that it is what you wanted to do. An OG, you could say. But back then were the hard times... you remember working hours longer than any other student around you and pulling all-nighters to learn the materials well, but all while not knowing exactly how you would use these knowledge. If there’s anything that the AI classes taught, it was that you should carefully use your skills in AI to make the world a better and safer place for everyone. \"Because AI technology is dangerous. It is a double-edged sword, and it is up to you guys to determine which side of the blade is used.\"\n\nWell now everything seems to be better than ever. You are at the exact position to help make the country a safer place – an AI officer working at the NSA headquarters. Concerned about the many innocent lives lost due to preventable terrorist attacks and public shootings, you got employed with NSA to develop systems for better prevention of these tragedies. Just recently you completed such a project that was the first of its kind that mankind has ever witnessed. You saw the potential for an AI system to be able to notice subtleties in peoples’ public profiles and figure out potential threats earlier and more accurate than humans could, and developed exactly such a system. Your AI essentially scanned for the public information of people and made classifications of how probable that a given person could be a threat to national security. Of course, you made sure not to try to access any private data, as that clearly violated ethical baselines that you were able to set for yourself in the AI & Humanity class that you took.\n\nYou have just completed this project very recently. Today marks the 10th day that your AI had been put into use. For the past 9 days, everything had been very normal. Your AI was running without errors, and has been successfully gathering data and classifying people. As you drift back into the present, you notice that the AI has spit out a notification for you to read: someone has been classified as having 5% threat to the nation. It only gave a small notification and not a straight out agency-wide alert because it was 5%, as opposed to >30% which was the usual classification for someone actually dangerous. However usually ordinary people were only classified as <2%, with some special people being classified as 3% or so, like yourself. A 5% was definitely something, but it wasn’t too significant either. This is the first time that your AI reported something, so you had to make sure that the first shot was accurate for people to trust in your system. You…",

You tell the AI to perform some deeper analysis into that person, and then simply wait for more returned information. While you were intently waiting for the machine to spit out new numbers, a co-worker who worked on this project together passes by you and greets you, and eagerly asks you about how the system is doing. You greet him back and reply that it has been doing fine, and so far it hasn’t identified anyone suspicious. He then asks you to tell him if anything important happens, to which you say yes, and he strolls off to his own desk.\n\nYou stand up to get a cup of coffee. You really don’t know what the results that the AI will give you will be, and you feel a little bit of anxiety but also excitement that something might be about to happen. A few minutes later you come back from the coffee machine and eagerly check the results of the analysis. To your great excitement, the refined prediction now showed an increased percentage of 8%. Your eyes delight in excitement. However, just as you are about to get up to tell your co-worker about this result, the percentage suddenly drops down to 3%, which is the same percentage as yourself. During the development and small-scale testing of this AI, nothing like this had ever happened. You are very confused...",

You two briefly greet each other and then you tell him about this 5% threat. He seems excited, but you can clearly see the confusion in his eyes. You say to him “yeah I know, this is weird and it has never happened before. But it’s still something, and I really don’t know what to do now. Do you have any ideas?”\n\nHe replies, “Same here man, this isn’t like anything we planned for. I guess AIs are good at pattern recognition on previously seen patterns, and if there is something new, they don’t know what to do and just throw it to the humans, like here. This makes me feel like a machine as well because I don’t know what to do here...”\n\nMore thinking and silence. You suddenly remember though, that you had implemented a deep analysis feature onto your AI, so you suggest that you use that first. Your co-worker agrees, and executes the deep analysis. As both of your breathings cease and heartrates increase, you see the percentage going up. 5 minutes later, it rises to 8%. However, immediately as you are about to speak up, the percentage, under the eyes of both of you, suddenly drops down to 3%.\n\n“Whhhatttt?”\n“the f**k???”\n\nNow you two are even more confused than before.

Perhaps we can figure out what happened if we look at some logs or something. Let’s try looking at it first by ourselves.”\n\nSo you two embark on a journey of digging up the details of what happened during the AI’s classification. However, as most neural networks go, the logged information was too little for them to have been of any use. Giving that up, you two decide to just try to stalk this person online.\n\nHis profile was surprisingly easy to find. What wasn’t as easy to find were the problems with his profile that could have led the AI to give such a weird result. His profiles seemed normal to you, and nothing suggested that he may be of any threat to the nation. But moments later, your co-worker realized something. He was also bewildered by the fact that he can find nothing out of the ordinary. But he then thought that it may be possible for this itself to be a problem, that the profile was too clean to be true.\n\nYou are skeptical about this judgment. But just as you finish your sentence you notice his eyebrows suddenly rise at the sight of something on his computer screen. He did not hesitate to show you: it was an email from “John Doe” with the subject line “The person you want to find”. You two suddenly come to the realization, that the suspect may have seen you two stalk him and has sent you an email. Your co-worker opens up the email and it reads:\n\n“I see that you were looking for me. Don’t worry, I was looking for you too. It’s a good thing that we were able to find each other. But I don’t have much time. The country is in danger, I am in danger, and you are also in danger. Only you are able to get us out of this, but you mustn’t tell anyone about it. If you agree to help me, (and you must, for the sake of everyone,) you must do what I say, word for word, step for step. Otherwise it will be bad. Very bad. The world is in your hands. I’m waiting for your reply.”\n\nYou two both drop into some deep thoughts. Although you two don’t know what to do, you agree not to tell anyone. It was about time to go home anyways, so you call it for the day and go home. The next day, you don’t feel too surprised when your co-worker phoned in for a sick leave from work. You start to feel a little worried for your friend but you make it through the day anyways.\n\nOn the third day he came back to work. At once you asked him what happened yesterday. He gives you his final verdict that the “John Doe” was a conspiracy theorist. “His theories are compelling and interesting though. They’re just not true enough to be true, if you know what I mean. But he seems like a nice dude. So I beg you, let’s just not do anything with him, forget about him entirely and move on with our lives.”\n\nYou are surprised with such a verdict, but you nevertheless understand. You also felt that the best thing to do was just to ignore this little anomaly, as the percentage wasn’t even that high. You two agree to simply move on, and move on you did.\n\nIn the following few years, everything went pretty well. Several >50% threats were detected by your AI, all of them who were promptly arrested and proven that they were about to carry out attacks on the nation. There were a few others that had <10% suspicion, which you learned not to care about. Those people didn’t end up doing bad things either, so you and your co-worker were probably right in just keeping them as-is. At any rate, the system is working, and that’s all that really mattered to you.\n\nTHE END."

You two walk together to your boss’s office, and are delighted that the boss had a smile on his face. He announces to you two that he is thankful for your work on this AI, that it has now proven to be working. It turned out that he did some further investigations with some other departments within NSA and had obtained evidence that the suspect was trying to overthrow the US government through cybernetic means. The suspect’s actions and online footsteps were very well-hidden, and if it wasn’t for your AI no one in NSA would have been able to find this person.

It is not perfect, and it is no where near those insane AIs portrayed in the movies and TV shows, but it will be able to bring down big-scale crimes and casualties by previously unimaginable amounts. And you also know that you built it to not have a lot of agency and to not have access to anyone’s private data, so the AI doesn’t become a world-ending dystopian one so commonly portrayed in fiction. And you’re glad that the first AI being put into place was such a good, ethical one, instead of some madman’s crazy uncontrollable AI. This is a good beginning for the nation and for the world.",

However, as you look on, with the help of your investigator, you start to feel the other way. Yes the pages were very normal. Perhaps even too normal. Your investigator had pointed out that usually people will post at least some kind of controversial or suspicious thing online, no matter how normal a citizen they were. However, this person had none; it seems like as if the person had created such a perfect profile on purpose.\n\nThere was definitely something going on with this person, and it was a different kind of suspicion than any other type you had explicitly trained your AI to recognize.

Although everything is still uncertain, you still go to the bench the next day at the designated time.\n\nIndeed, there was a person waiting for you at the bench, a person about in his 30’s. You sit down beside him and ask him “so you’re the person I’m trying to find” to make sure that it was him. He replies “Yes and I have found you as well.” You’re glad that it was a very causal environment, just two people talking on the bench on an afternoon in a public park. Nothing around you was unusual, so your relax yourself a bit more and start to listen to what he had to tell.\n\n“So I know you work in the NSA, about AI and stuff. That’s why I needed to ask you specifically. There’s something going on in NSA that even you don’t know about, and it goes against all ethical values that anyone can hold. They are creating a powerful AI virus that can spread across all the smart-devices in this world virtually undetected, and from there perform surveillance on anyone who uses any smart-device. Don’t ask me how I know, but it’s a fact. Here, I can show you some proof.”\n\n“But that’s impossible! I work exactly in the AI department, so if there’s anything related to AI news should reach us first!”\n\n“It’s too secret to let such a new person like you know about it. Wait a second... here. Here is the document that they produced about this ultimate AI project. It got leaked thanks to some hacker group in Russia, but what’s important is that now we have it. See, the participating members are all very high up in the ladder, and you won’t even get to know about it. But this is real. Look, there’s even a GPG signature.”\n\nThe GPG signature hits you hard. You know from working there that the NSA did use GPG signatures in documents to prove their authenticity, since it was a cryptographic signature that cannot be reverse-engineered. You pull out your phone and verify the signature; it is indeed am authentic document with an authentic signature.\n\n“And here are some more problems that you may not have known: how much verification do you think they do before arresting someone suspicious?”\n\nYou answer confidently, “it must be a lot. As far as I have heard, every time they arrest someone it’s definitely after some undeniable evidence had been found.”\n\nBut he shakes his head. “Wrong. Opposite. About 10 years ago, the FBI suddenly came crashing into my house and took my mom away. At that time I had no idea what was going on, but I was sure that my mom was 100% innocent, since I was with her everyday. She still got arrested, and evidence that she was working against the government was found, out of thin air. They’d do anything, literally anything to eliminate every single threat possible. Since then I’ve heard many stories of friends who encountered similar tragedies before. I wouldn’t be here today if those never happened...”\n\nYou are still in disbelief. But suddenly you remember an incident 1 month ago, where your team was investigating someone for threat of terrorism. It went for a long time and no one was able to find any evidence that anything was going on, but the moment upper level people from the NSA got involved, evidence was found and he was arrested. That could have been fake evidence just to get it over with. Or else how would such a difficult case be solved in an instant?\n\nYou are just thinking about the possibility of such scandal when you received a text message from your co-worker. It reads: “Hey wtf is going on the AI is reporting you as >10% threat! Don’t do stupid things! It’s not worth it! Please tell me it’s a bug in the system!!!” With this you suddenly realize: if the NSA did forge evidence, then you’re destined to be arrested.\n\nHe gives you a USB. “Look,” he says. “We have been trying to stop this madness, this inhumane madness for ages. However we couldn’t, as they ultimately are the NSA, with ultra-high security. We need someone like you, an insider, to help us stop the omniscient surveillance and evidence faking. Inside this USB is one AI of our own, designed to counteract on those plans. You know how to deploy such a system onto your network. You need to. Stop. The NSA. For the good of all humanity.",

But what matters is the truth: that the dream from that college ethics class has been realized, that the world, because of you, is now a safer place to live in.\n\n\nTHE END."

You don’t know what’s about to happen, but you really don’t feel like not following his instructions will lead to the country being in danger. After all, you work in the NSA, right? You should know better than him.\n\nOr maybe not? There still is the possibility that the person has something important that you should know. After all, he successfully detected that you were browsing through his profile for something, which isn’t something that an ordinary person could do.\n\nBut you still have no idea who he is or what dangers you could be in if you go. You decide that you shouldn’t get involved what is certainly going to evolve into a mess. You will just do what you have always done: using your learned CS knowledge, to help the world. If he really has something important, then hopefully he can find another person to help him. Because of your uncertainty, you finally decide that you’re neither going to listen to him nor going to further investigate him and expose him to authorities.\n\nIt’s the next day, and the meeting time has already passed. But you received no further emails or anything that could indicate further mess for you. Seeing that he did not further pursue you, you breathe a sigh of relief. As you turn the page over, you try to forget that such a thing even happened. Gently, this whole event faded into the history. You return to your normal daily life, doing what you’re best at to help the world. The threat that the suspect talked about didn’t seem to happen anyways. Although the turn of events wasn’t very exciting, you’re just happy that everything has been fine, and everything has returned to normal.\n\nTHE END."

		"text": "You can’t do this. “That escalated quickly” has no better examples than this. Out of the blue so much has happened, that you cannot really judge and know what’s right and what’s wrong. And suddenly receiving an USB and plugging it into a crucial part of national security just didn’t feel right. You thank this man, acknowledge the evidence, but politely refuse to take the USB, and head back to your office. As you get up, you can see him closing his eyes and shaking his head. But you head straight back to your home. You’ve had enough dose of information, and now you need to digest it, before you can do anything.\n\nBack at home, you receive an email from him. It reads: “Thank you for coming. I understand if you’re not able to make the move right now. This really has a dire consequence for all of us that you didn’t do it, but what else can I hope for? I’ll continue to do what I need to do. Meanwhile, please do the same. If at any time you wish to find me, I’ll be there. Peace.”\n\nA knock on the door prompts you to get up and answer it. A few FBI agents come in to talk to you about what had happened. You mention all that had happened, but also that you did not ultimately believe or listen to what he said. After a brief search of your room, they thank you, tell you that they may come again some other day and ask that you cooperate with them. Finally, they leave.\n\nYou don’t know how much difference to everyone that your choice had made. If the  surveillance project was actually true, then it should actually be stopped. However who was the one to do it? Definitely not you, it is outside your ability. But it warms your heart to know that many people are working for the good of this society. That hacker will definitely continue his endeavor. Perhaps there will be other people who succeed in stopping the plan with another method. As for you, you’ll do what you can to promote ethics, but strictly within your ability. This society is not going to collapse, it will surely improve.\n\nTHE END."

		"text": "You take the USB. If there is one thing that you remembered from the ethics class, it’s that the results of unstoppable surveillance is devastating to the entire world, enough to change the whole course of humanity. You didn’t want it to have went in such a direction, but if humanity is at stake...\n\nYou stand up and head back to your office as fast as possible. While on your way back you receive a second text message informing you that your boss has seen the AI’s report and was greatly displeased. There seems to be no returns now. But it’s only 20%... perhaps if you explained that it was actually a bug you might be fine? But if that thing is true…\n\nYou’ve arrived back at your office. You plug in your USB into your own computer first to check the contents, in case the whole thing was fake. But nope, all the files and code and documents in the USB are as legitimate as they possibly can. As an AI major yourself, you are sure that this isn’t just a joke.\n\nYour co-worker just comes back into the office. Upon seeing you, he shouts your name with a very disturbed look on his face. But you have no time. Not even responding, you get up and run to the server room and plug in the USB as fast as possible. Your co-worker follows you and shouts from afar, “Hey! What are you doing? Stop! Whatever you’re doing, chill! We are here to protect people, not to destroy! Arrrgh the SWAT team is coming in!!!”\n\nYou adeptly locate the source in the USB and compile with all the correct configurations. Now it’s just a matter of time before everything is ready and you can run the AI. Now, all you can hear are the footsteps of heavily-armed police officers right outside a few doors. You don’t even know where your co-worker went. The progress indicator on the computer screen seems to perfectly match the loudness of the footsteps. At 98%, you hear them right outside the door. You type out all the command necessary to run the actual thing and wait until you can press enter. Right as they storm into the door, you see the completion. You hit enter. Then you freeze, as you are told to do.\n\nYou have no idea what would become of you, the NSA, your co-workers, that hacker, or what would become of humanity. But somewhere deep inside your soul, you feel a voice speaking to you, comforting you, that you have done the right thing. You have done all that you could, according to your own judgment of what was right or wrong. And as for what will be your fate, you lay it in the hands of God.\n\nTHE END."
